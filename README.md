# Crop-Anamoly-Detection

Designed & developed a self-sustained smart polyhouse with a checkerboard-patterned solar PV system for optimal
shading and energy generation.
– Prototyped a 3D printed model with real-time atmosphere control using sensors and the ESP8266 microcontroller.
– Optimizing design and PV panels placement through Numerical Modeling for enhanced solar energy harvesting
will follow.
– Going to develop a ML model leveraging Computer Vision and Image Processing using YOLO algorithm to
monitor crop growth, detect anomalies, and manage crop health.
